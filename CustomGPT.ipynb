This can result in the model performing very well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. Overfitting can be a problem because the model fails to generalize well to new data and may not perform well in real-world applications. \n",

The purpose of validation is to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data. By splitting the dataset into training and validation sets, we can tune the model's hyperparameters, assess its performance, and prevent overfitting. Validation helps us ensure that the model is not just memorizing the training data but actually learning the underlying patterns that can be applied to new data. \n",
